cookiecutter-es6babelpack
=========================

This is a simple cookiecutter project to get you up and running with an
ES6-based front end project.


Installation (without cookiecutter - skip if installed)
-------------------------------------------------------

> curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python
> pip install cookiecutter

Note: You'll have to run the above as sudo unless you're running from a Python
virtualenv.


Running
-------

> cookiecutter gh:demianbrecht/cookiecutter-es6babelpack
> project_name []: <NAME>
> project_version [0.1.0]: <VERSION>
> description []: <DESCRIPTION>
> author []: <AUTHOR>
> license [UNLICENSED]: <LICENSE>
>
> cd <NAME>
> make install

The above will create a project under the directory <NAME> and install the
npm dependencies required to get you up and running. At this point, the only
other targets of interest are `serve` and `test`. `test` will run mocha
tests and `serve` will run the project through a webpack-dev-server (source
code will automatically be rebuilt).

After running `make serve`, `open localhost:8080` should result in a page with
"hello, <NAME>!" inserted into the DOM.
